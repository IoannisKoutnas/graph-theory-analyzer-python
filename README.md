# Graph Theory Analysis – Karate Club

An interactive Python application that visualizes and analyzes the classic Karate Club graph using graph theory algorithms.

## Features
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal animation
- Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal animation
- Greedy graph coloring visualization
- Cycle detection
- Maximum clique finding and visualization
- Logging panel for outputs

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Matplotlib (for graph drawing and animation)
- NetworkX (graph algorithms)

**Run the application**
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

---

## Usage

- Choose actions like BFS, DFS, Coloring, Cycle, or Clique from the right-side control panel.
- The graph visualization and the log window will display results for each algorithm step.
- Use "Clear Log" to reset and "Exit" to close the program.
